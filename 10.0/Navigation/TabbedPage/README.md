# TabbedPage

This sample demonstrates how to use a `TabbedPage` to navigate through a collection of pages. The `TabbedPage` is constructed by assigning a collection to the `ItemsSource` property and assigning a `DataTemplate` to the `ItemTemplate` property to return pages for objects in the collection.

For more information about the sample see [Tabbed Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/user-interface/pages/tabbedpage).
