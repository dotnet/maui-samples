Any raw assets you want to be deployed with your application can be placed in
this directory (and child directories) and given a Build Action of "MauiAsset":

	<MauiAsset Include="AboutAssets.txt" />

These files will be deployed with you package and will be accessible using Essentials:

	async Task LoadMauiAsset()
	{
		using var stream = await FileSystem.OpenAppPackageFileAsync("AboutAssets.txt");
		using var reader = new StreamReader(stream);

		var contents = reader.ReadToEnd();
	}
