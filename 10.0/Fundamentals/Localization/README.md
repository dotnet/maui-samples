# Localization

Localization is the process of adapting an app to meet the specific language or cultural requirements of a target market. To accomplish localization, the text and images in an app may need to be translated into multiple languages. A localized app automatically displays translated text based on the culture settings of the device.

This sample demonstrates how to localize .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) app strings, images, and app names.
