# Data binding

A .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) data binding links a pair of properties between two objects, at least one of which is usually a user-interface object, so that changes in one property are automatically reflected in the other property. These two objects are called the *target* and the *source*:

- The *target* is the object (and property) on which the data binding is set.
- The *source* is the object (and property) referenced by the data binding.

This sample demonstrates different data binding techniques that are available in .NET MAUI.
