# RefreshView

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `RefreshView` is a container control that provides pull to refresh functionality for scrollable content. Therefore, the child of a `RefreshView` must be a scrollable control, such as `ScrollView`, `CollectionView`, or `ListView`.

This sample demonstrates how to use the .NET MAUI `RefreshView`.

For more information about this sample, see [.NET MAUI RefreshView](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/refreshview).
