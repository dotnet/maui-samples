# HybridWebView

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `HybridWebView` enables hosting arbitrary HTML/JS/CSS content in a web view, and enables communication between the code in the web view (JavaScript) and the code that hosts the web view (C#/.NET). The entire app, including the web content, is packaged and runs locally on a device, and can be published to applicable app stores. The web content is hosted within a native web view control and runs within the context of the app. Any part of the app can access external web services, but isn't required to.

This sample demonstrates how to use a .NET MAUI `HybridWebView` to host HTML/JS/CSS content, and communicate between that content and .NET.
