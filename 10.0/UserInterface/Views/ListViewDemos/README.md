# ListView

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `ListView` displays a scrollable vertical list of selectable data items. While `ListView` manages the appearance of the list, the appearance of each item in the list is defined by a `DataTemplate` that uses a `Cell` to display items. .NET MAUI includes cell types to display combinations of text and images, and you can also define custom cells that display any content you want. `ListView` also includes support for displaying headers and footers, grouped data, pull-to-refresh, and context menu items.

This sample demonstrates how to use the .NET MAUI `ListView`.
