# ContentView

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `ContentView` is a control that enables the creation of custom, reusable controls.

This sample demonstrates how to create a custom `CardView` control, based on the `ContentView` class, and instantiate it in XAML, XAML with data bindings, and code. This sample also demonstrates how to use a `ControlTemplate` to override the layout of a custom control such as the `CardView` class.

For more information about this sample, see [.NET MAUI ContentView](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/contentview).
