# XAML fundamentals

XAML allows you to define user interfaces in .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) apps using markup rather than code. XAML is never required in a .NET MAUI app, but it's often the preferred and a more succinct approach to building a UI than equivalent code. XAML is particularly well suited for use with the popular MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) app architecture: XAML defines the View that is linked to ViewModel code through XAML-based data bindings.

This sample demonstrates .NET MAUI XAML fundamentals.
