# Behaviors

.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) behaviors let you add functionality to user interface controls without having to subclass them. Instead, the functionality is implemented in a behavior class and attached to the control as if it was part of the control itself.

This sample demonstrates creating and consuming attached behaviors and .NET MAUI behaviors.

For more information about this sample, see [.NET MAUI Behaviors](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/fundamentals/behaviors).
