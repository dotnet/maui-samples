# Consume a REST-based web service

This sample demonstrates a Todo list application where the data is stored and accessed from a REST-based web service. The web service code is in the TodoAPI project.

The app functionality is:

- View a list of tasks.
- Add, edit, and delete tasks.
- Set a task's status to 'done'.

In all cases the tasks are stored in an in-memory collection that's accessed through a REST-based web service.
