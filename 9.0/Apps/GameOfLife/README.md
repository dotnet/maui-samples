# Game of Life

This is an implementation of the Game of Life for .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI). Life is a cellular automaton invented by mathematician John Conway in 1970 and popularized in *Scientfic American*.

Tap cells to make them "alive" A clustered population of live cells works the best. Then press the **Run!** button. Rules are applied to the live cells to generate successive populations. A population might grow, or shrink, or stagnate, or disappear.
