# Invoke platform code

This sample demonstrates two different approaches to invoking platform code in a .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) app. The first uses conditional compilation to target different platforms, and the second uses partial methods.

For more information about the sample see [Invoke platform code](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/platform-integration/invoke-platform-code).
