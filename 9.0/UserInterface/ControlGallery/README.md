# Control gallery

The user interface of a .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) app is constructed of objects that map to the native controls of each target platform.

The main control groups used to create the user interface of a .NET MAUI app are pages, layouts, and views. A .NET MAUI page generally occupies the full screen or window. The page usually contains a layout, which contains views and possibly other layouts. Pages, layouts, and views derive from the `VisualElement` class. This class provides a variety of properties, methods, and events that are useful in derived classes.

This sample displays all of the controls available in .NET MAUI, one per page.

For more information about .NET MAUI controls, see [.NET MAUI controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/).
