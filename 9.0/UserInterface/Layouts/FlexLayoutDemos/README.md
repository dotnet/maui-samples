# FlexLayout

This sample demonstrates how to use the .NET MAUI Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `FlexLayout`, which can arrange its children horizontally and vertically in a stack, and can also wrap its children if there are too many to fit in a single row or column.

For more information about this sample, see [.NET MAUI FlexLayout](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/user-interface/layouts/flexlayout).
