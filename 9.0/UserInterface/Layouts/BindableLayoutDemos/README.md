# BindableLayout

This sample demonstrates how to use the .NET MAUI Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `BindableLayout`, which enables any layout class that derives from the `Layout` class to generate its content by binding to a collection of items, with the option to set the appearance of each item with a `DataTemplate`.

For more information about this sample, see [.NET MAUI BindableLayout](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/user-interface/layouts/bindablelayout).
