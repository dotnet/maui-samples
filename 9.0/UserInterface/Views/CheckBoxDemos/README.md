# CheckBox

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `CheckBox` is a type of button that can either be checked or empty. When a checkbox is checked, it's considered to be on. When a checkbox is empty, it's considered to be off.

This sample demonstrates how to use a .NET MAUI `CheckBox` in code, XAML with code-behind, and XAML data-binding scenarios.
