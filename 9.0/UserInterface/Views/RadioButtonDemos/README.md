# RadioButton

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `RadioButton` is a type of button that allows users to select one option from a set. Each option is represented by one radio button, and you can only select one radio button in a group. By default, each `RadioButton` displays text.

This sample demonstrates how to use the .NET MAUI `RadioButton`.
