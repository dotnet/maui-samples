# .NET MAUI TwoPaneView playground

This sample demonstrates the different properties of the TwoPaneView layout control and how they affect its child views. TwoPaneView adapts to foldable and dual-screen Android devices (like [Surface Duo](https://learn.microsoft.com/dual-screen)) - on all other platforms it behaves as a proportional splitview layout.

For more information, see the [.NET MAUI TwoPaneView](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/twopaneview/) page.

Most details from the old [Xamarin TwoPaneView control](https://learn.microsoft.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms/app-fundamentals/dual-screen/twopaneview) still apply.
