# Shapes

A .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `Shape` is a type of `View` that enables you to draw a shape to the screen. `Shape` objects can be used inside layout classes and most controls, because the `Shape` class derives from the `View` class.

This sample demonstrates how to use .NET MAUI Shapes, to draw different shapes.

For more information about the sample, see [.NET MAUI Shapes](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/shapes/).
