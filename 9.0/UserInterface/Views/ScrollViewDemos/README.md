# ScrollView

The .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) `ScrollView` is a view that's capable of scrolling its content. By default, `ScrollView` scrolls its content vertically. A `ScrollView` can only have a single child, although this can be other layouts.

This sample demonstrates how to use the .NET MAUI `ScrollView`.
