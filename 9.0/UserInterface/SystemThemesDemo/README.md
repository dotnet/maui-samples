# Respond to system theme changes

.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) apps can respond to system theme changes by consuming resources with the `AppThemeBinding` markup extension, and the `SetAppThemeColor` and `SetAppTheme<T>` extension methods.

This sample demonstrates a .NET MAUI app that responds to system theme changes.
