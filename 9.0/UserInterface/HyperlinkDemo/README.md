# Hyperlinks

In a .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) app, the text displayed by `Label` and `Span` objects can be turned into hyperlinks by using text decorations, and a `TapGestureRecognizer`.

This sample demonstrates how `Label` and `Span` objects can be turned into hyperlinks.

For more information about this sample, see [Create a hyperlink](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/label#create-a-hyperlink).
