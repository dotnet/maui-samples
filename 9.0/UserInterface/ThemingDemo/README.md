# Theming

Theming can be implemented in .NET MAUI Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) apps by creating a `ResourceDictionary` for each theme, and then loading the resources with the `DynamicResource` markup extension.

This sample demonstrates a .NET MAUI app that uses theming, and which allows the theme to be changed at runtime.

For more information about this sample, see [Theme a .NET MAUI app](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/user-interface/theming).
